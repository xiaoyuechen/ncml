\section{SAT solver using genetic algorithms}
We propose to develop and evaluate a SAT solver which uses genetic algorithms.

\subsection{Introduction}
The satisfiability problem (SAT) is a NP-complete problem
(\cite{cook_1971}). Problems from Sudoku, N-queen to AI planning,
optimization and electric circuit design could all be modelled to SAT problems.
Hence, a SAT solver is a general purpose platform for solving various
real-world problems and has obvious importance.
