	\begin{equation*}
		\overbrace{(Paris \vee \neg Berlin \vee Madrid)}^{Mumin} \wedge \overbrace{(\neg Madrid \vee London \vee Berlin)}^{Snufkin} \wedge
		\overbrace{(\neg Paris \vee London \vee Madrid)}^{Sniff}

\begin{alertblock}{What if we choosing another way?}
	Using incomplete methods is kind of taking a step
	back.
	\begin{itemize}
		\normalsize
		\item If there are many destinations and many people planning the trip together,
		      using complete methods is slow.
		\item We just want a solution if there is one. If the solver runs for too long, we
		      just stop it and use the best answer it has given. We do not care about
		      proving that no solution exists.
		\item Many incomplete methods are successful in solving SAT
		      problems\parencite{biere2009handbook}.

\frametitle{Why genetic algorithm?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Genetic algorithm is a widely used heuristic searching method
	      \parencite{Voss}.
	\item Numerous incomplete solvers have been invented to solve SAT problems
	      \parencite{marchiori1999flipping, selman1994noise}.
	\item Classical genetic algorithms have poor performance.
	\item The main challenge for incomplete methods is how to escape local minima.
\end{itemize}
