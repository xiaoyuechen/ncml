	\begin{block}{Selection}
		Use a modified version of tournament selection to get healthy parents for crossover.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Crossover}
	We consider 5 types of crossover to create potentially promising new individuals: Corrective Clause (CC) crossover,
	Fleurent and Ferland (F\&F) crossover, uniform crossover, one-point and two-point crossover. By analyzing the results, we could get the best one.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Mutation}
		Use WalkSAT local search that interleaves the greedy moves with random walk moves, trying to determine the best move by flipping a variable.
	\end{block}

	\textbf{1. Difference in population iteration:}
	\begin{alertblock}{classical genetic SAT solver:}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item perform genetic operators on each individual accordingly.
		\item update the whole generation with new generation.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{alertblock}{GNTSAT:}		
		\begin{itemize}
		\item choose a pair of parents among the bests to crossover and then mutate the child. 
		\item replace the olderest individual with the newly generated child.
		\end{itemize}	
	\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

	\textbf{2. Difference in mutation operator:}
	\begin{alertblock}{classical genetic SAT solver:}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item flip one or more variables at once from its initial state.
		\item do not consider the structure of the 3-SAT instance.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{alertblock}{GNTSAT:}	
		\begin{itemize}
		\item use the WalkSAT local search as the mutation operator.
		\item always start with a newly generated child that is near to the solution.
		\item use the structure information of the 3-SAT instance (randomly pick a clause among those that are currently unsatisfied, then flip a variable within that clause with some conditions).
		\end{itemize}
