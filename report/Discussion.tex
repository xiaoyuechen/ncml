\subsection{Different Crossover Methods}
In our experiments, we performed five different crossover methods. We could find that uniform method got the best result in our experiments. It would not surprise us because CC and FF are based on uniform crossover so they would do more bit flips and take more time than uniform crossover. We have observed that using CC and FF crossover would make it faster to converge on low variable number benchmarks, and we believe that they would show more advantages if we have more complex experiments. On the other hand, one-point and two-point crossover are much more similar. These two kinds of methods are doing consequent bit string swapping. However, this kind of swapping would help little for our searching because clauses rarely include consequent bit string. Thus, the only advance these two kinds of crossover giving us would be maintaining population diversity.
