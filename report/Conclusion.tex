\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced our SAT solver based on a genetic algorithm and its performance on different benchmarks. The experiment results have illustrated that our solver has a better performance comparing with WalkSAT. In addition, we have tried to use different crossover methods in our algorithm and finally uniform crossover got the best result over those methods. Although we cannot say with certainty that this is the best crossover method, at least it gave the best results under the scenario experiment mentioned in this paper. 

We believe that we have developed a mature solver to solve the 3-SAT problem. Due to the limited time, we could not have more experiments on it, but we still expect its performance in more complex benchmarks and want to know if it has a better performance comparing with other solvers. Our future work would focus on collecting other solvers' performances and compared them with our solver, thus we may do possible improvement on our solver. Besides, considering our algorithm is based on an incomplete method, we would like to extend it to solve the MAX-SAT problem to show its superiority.
