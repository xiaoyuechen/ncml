* NCML
  This repository contains the source code, proposal, report and
  presentation for the project of Natural Computation Methods for
  Machine Learning --- [[file:gntsat][GNTSAT]].

** GNTSAT
   GNTSAT is a hybrid SAT solver based on WalkSAT and Genetic
   Algorithms. GNTSAT outperforms WalkSAT in many benchmark instances
   (see [[file:report]] for details).

*** Building
    After cloning the repository, ~cd~ to [[file:gntsat]]. Then run the
    following commands to build the solver using CMake (requires CMake
    version >= 3.14):

    #+begin_src shell
      mkdir build
      cmake -S . -B build
      cmake --build build
    #+end_src

    The executable ~gntsat~ will be under the ~build~ directory.

*** Usage
    #+begin_src
      gntsat [--crossover=COTYPE] FILE

        COTYPE  cc, ff, uniform, onepoint, or twopoint
        FILE    The path of DIMACS CNF problem file
    #+end_src

    To know the difference between the crossover types, see [[file:report]].
